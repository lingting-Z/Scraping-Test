In these new guidelines, the U.S. government could ask the individuals or companies that allow payments to ransomware extortionists to pay for penalties.
The new guidelines state that facilitating these payments is a probable violation of the anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations.
Furthermore, the Treasure Department noted that violators could be held accountable to pay huge fines of up to $20 million.
â€œDemand for ransomware payments has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as cyber actors target online systems that U.S. persons rely on to continue conducting business,â€ stated the Treasuryâ€™s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
â€œCompanies that facilitate ransomware payments to cyber actors on behalf of victims, including financial institutions, cyber insurance firms, and companies involved in digital forensics and incident response, not only encourage future ransomware payment demands but also may risk violating OFAC regulations.â€
Also, the individual or the company could be fined even if they&#8217;re unaware that it was engaging or transacting with a sanctioned entity. Thus, ransomware is reminded that it&#8217;s important to talk to the OFAC before issuing any sort of payment.
&#8220;OFAC encourages victims and those involved with addressing ransomware attacks to contact OFAC immediately if they believe a request for a ransomware payment may involve a sanctions nexus,&#8221; the agency added.Â

U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley didn&#8217;t approve Pabst Brewing Co.â€™s motion to dismiss. According to the judge, the beer manufacturer should face the claims against them.
Pabst asserted that their marketing was not misleading customers into believing that Olympia Beer is made in Olympia, Washington. However, they aimed to evoke the â€œspiritâ€ of the region.
On the other hand, Judge Nunley didn&#8217;t accept this argument. The judge also discovered that consumers could be tricked by these advertisements since the original Olympia Beer brewery has shut down in 2003.Â 
â€œAs plaintiff alleges, the slogan â€˜Itâ€™s the Waterâ€™ denotes the quality of the naturally filtered, artesian water from the Olympia area of Washington,â€ Judge Nunley added.
Due to Judge Nunley&#8217;s ruling, plaintiff Brendan Peacock will continue with his claims under Californiaâ€™s Unfair Competition Law.
Last 2018, Peacock filed the Olympia Beer class action lawsuit, arguing about Pabstâ€™s marketing of its beer. According to him, the beerâ€™s manufacturing â€œfalsely create[es] the impressionâ€ that Olympia Beer is created with quality water from the region.
However, Olympia Beer is reportedly made across the country using local water supplies.
Peacock also argued that he and other consumers believed in representations that Olympia Beer was manufactured using â€œartesian waters.â€ Thus, they were allegedly made to believe that the beer was of a higher quality. Peacock also said that if he only knew that the beer wasn&#8217;t made with spring water, he wouldn&#8217;t purchase the beer at all.
Initially, the court dismissed Peacock&#8217;s first amended complaint. However, in the second amended complaint, it was approved that the plaintiff can move forward with his claims.

Consumers contend that Samsungâ€™s claim of water-resistant Galaxy S7 is false and untrue. Advertising materials for the phones show people snorkeling, surfing, and kayaking with their phones and represents that the phones â€œrepel spills, splashes, and even dunksâ€ in water. However, the reality is the phones fail after being submerged in water for a short period of time.
You can read about the case under the name
Do you or a family member own a Samsung Galaxy S7 that failed after being submerged for a short time in water? If you think that you are affected by this lawsuit send us a message today for help.
According to the class action lawsuit, â€œin a nationwide advertising campaign, Samsung portrays people dunking Galaxy S7 phones in fish tanks, spraying Galaxy S7 phones with jets of water and dousing them with champagne, and holding the phones while kayaking through river rapids and surfing in the ocean. Such depictions of water resistance permeate Samsungâ€™s advertisements of the Galaxy S7 phones, and the claimed water-resistant feature distinguishes these phones from similar products marketed and sold by Samsungâ€™s competitors. As part of its advertising campaign, Samsung consistently represents that the S7 Phone is â€˜water-resistant up to 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.â€™â€
A few of Samsungâ€™s marketing lines include â€œBecause water happensâ€, â€œFeel free to get your phone wetâ€, â€œrepel spills, splashes, and even dunks so you wonâ€™t be putting all your hopes in a pathetic bowl of riceâ€.
The claims were false and misleading, however as a consumerâ€™s phone â€œwas permanently damaged after she briefly dropped it in shallow water. The Galaxy S7 phones of many other consumers likewise have sustained damage from exposure to liquid or moisture.â€
The lawsuit further claims that â€œSamsungâ€™s representations inducedâ€¦ millions of consumers like her to purchase Samsungâ€™s purportedly water-resistant phones. Had these consumers known that Samsungâ€™s representations of water resistance were not accurate, they would not have purchased a Galaxy S7 phone, or they would have paid significantly less for the product.â€
Samsung is accused of committing fraud, violating the False Advertising Law (â€œFALâ€), Unfair Competition Law (â€œUCLâ€), and unjust enrichment.

After conducting an internal audit, Apple found out that 18 percent of those devices (103,845 all told) were still using the internet via various cellular networks. Furthermore, the number could even rise because of all the devices that are using the web via Wi-Fi.
According to The Verge, Apple said that products â€œsent for recycling are no longer adequate to sell to consumers and if they are rebuilt with counterfeit parts they could cause serious safety issues, including electrical or battery defects.â€
The GEEP Canada is the former recycling partner mentioned in the lawsuit. This company is now owned by Quantum Lifecycle.

Due to this issue, Apple has filed a lawsuit against GEEP for a minimum of 31 million Canadian dollars (roughly $23.4 million U.S.)
In this lawsuit, Apple asserts that GEEP admitted that around 12,000 pounds of Apple devices lift GEEPâ€™s premises without being destroyed.
Moreover, GEEP did not deny that a theft occurred. However, the company blamed three employees who allegedly sold the devices on their own for their gain.

Earlier this year, the FCCâ€™s STIR/SHAKEN initiative was launched which ordered all phone carriers and companies to adopt new policies and procedures.
First, the FCC went after malicious caller ID spoofing, which can trick consumers into falsely thinking that a caller is calling from a company or government agency.
Six months later since the initiative began, screws on robocallers are being tightened by barring voice service providers from adding line-item charges to their bills for caller ID authentication, which results in consumer protection from surprise charges.
Alex Quilici, CEO of robocall-blocking software company YouMail said that &#8220;these rules put the squeeze on carriers to do more to block illegal calls before they hit consumers, while not allowing them to charge extra for it.&#8221;
Communications companies are advised to upgrade their network systems or do whatever it takes for them to meet the new standards if they canâ€™t put STIR/SHAKEN into action.
FCC is giving â€œlimited extensionsâ€ to companies who may have problems in upgrading their networks, with the understanding that robocall abatement programs are being put into place in their systems.
